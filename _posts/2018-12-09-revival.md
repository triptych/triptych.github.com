There are so many places that I could use to update the world on what I am working on. 
It seems like the best place, however, might be here, because I can code things however I want, and I can use
Github's built in editors to update content.  

Currently working on:

* Learning Rust
* Learning Godot Engine
* Always learning new JavaScript
* Working on my fantasy novel FairyBlight.
